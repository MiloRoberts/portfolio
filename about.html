            </header>
            <p>After spending the majority of the 2010s living and working in East Asia, I was itching for a change. I'd
                always had at least a passing interest in computers, and the thought of being able to build my own
                websites enticed me to try web development. So I left my job teaching English in S. Korea and enrolled
                in an associate
                degree program.</p>
            <p>Fast-forward a bit in time, and I'm now working as a student instructor anxiously
                awaiting my next challenge.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Music, history, Japanese, old video games... I have a lot of interests. My fascination with history has
                slowly
                increased over the years to the point at which, nowadays, rather than falling asleep to some Genesis or
                Cure
                album, I'm instead dozing off to audio lectures on the Black Death and Classical Greece.</p>
